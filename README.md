# 🏠 HOUSECHAIN

## 📄 Project Description
**HOUSECHAIN** is a decentralized property management system built on Ethereum.  
It allows users to list, buy, and transfer ownership of properties using blockchain technology — ensuring transparency, trust, and immutability in real estate transactions.

## 🌍 Project Vision
To revolutionize the real estate market by creating a **trustless, transparent, and efficient** ecosystem where property transactions occur securely without intermediaries.

## ✨ Key Features
- **List Property:** Owners can list properties with location and price.
- **Buy Property:** Buyers can purchase listed properties directly using Ether.
- **Change Sale Status:** Owners can toggle whether their property is for sale.
- **On-chain Ownership:** Every ownership transfer is permanently recorded on the blockchain.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with **ERC-721 tokens** for tokenized property ownership.
- Implementation of **property verification via oracles**.
- Adding **bidding/auction system** for dynamic property sales.
- A **web3 frontend** for seamless user interaction (e.g., with MetaMask).
